# Foodwise:  Fighting Food Waste with AI - Smart Food Management in Your Pocket

**Foodwise** is an innovative mobile application prototype designed to empower individuals and businesses to **dramatically reduce food waste** through the intelligent application of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. Born from the prestigious **Huawei Seeds For The Future program** (October 2023 - January 2024), Foodwise is not just an idea, but a **winning solution**, recognized for its potential to address a critical global challenge.

**The Problem: The Growing Crisis of Food Waste**

Food waste is a massive global issue with far-reaching consequences:

*   **Environmental Impact:**  Wasted food contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, land and water overuse, and pollution from landfills.
*   **Economic Losses:**  Households and businesses lose substantial amounts of money due to uneaten food.
*   **Social Injustice:**  In a world where hunger persists, vast quantities of perfectly edible food are discarded.

**Foodwise: An AI-Powered Solution**

Foodwise tackles this problem head-on by providing users with intelligent tools to manage their food more effectively.  This mobile app prototype, conceived and developed during the Huawei Seeds For The Future program, leverages AI to:

*   **Smart Inventory Management:**  Imagine easily tracking the food you have at home or in your business. Foodwise aims to offer intuitive ways to log your groceries, helping you understand what you have and when it might expire.  **(Note: Prototype functionality may be simplified, but the vision includes advanced inventory tracking).**
*   **Intelligent Expiry Date Prediction:**  Going beyond simple date labels, Foodwise envisions using AI to predict the *actual* freshness and shelf life of food items based on various factors.  **(Note: Prototype may not fully implement this, but it's a core concept).**  This could help users prioritize consumption and reduce spoilage.
*   **Recipe Recommendations based on Available Ingredients:**  Tired of staring into your fridge wondering what to cook? Foodwise aims to provide personalized recipe suggestions based on the food items you currently have, encouraging you to use up what you have before it goes to waste. **(Note: Prototype may demonstrate basic recipe linking or concept).**
*   **Waste Tracking and Insights:**  By logging food waste, users and businesses can gain valuable insights into their consumption patterns. Foodwise aims to provide data-driven feedback to help users identify areas where they can improve their food management habits and reduce waste over time.  **(Note: Prototype may include basic waste logging features).**
